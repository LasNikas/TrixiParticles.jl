Boundaries modeled as boundary particles which exert forces on the fluid particles (Monaghan, Kajtar, 2009).
The force on fluid particle ``a`` is given by
```math
f_a = m_a \sum_{b \in B} f_{ab} - m_b \Pi_{ab} \nabla_{r_a} W(\Vert r_a - r_b \Vert, h)
```
with
```math
f_{ab} = \frac{K}{\beta} \frac{r_{ab}}{\Vert r_{ab} \Vert^2} W(\Vert r_{ab} \Vert, h)
\frac{2 m_b}{m_a + m_b},
```
where ``B`` denotes the set of boundary particles, ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` are the masses of
fluid particle ``a`` and boundary particle ``b`` respectively, and
``r_{ab} = r_a - r_b`` is the difference of the coordinates of particles ``a`` and ``b``.

The boundary particles are assumed to have uniform spacing by the factor ``\beta`` smaller
than the expected fluid particle spacing.
For example, if the fluid particles have an expected spacing of `0.1` and the boundary particles
have a uniform spacing of `0.05`, then this parameter should be set to ``\beta = 2``.
According to (Monaghan, Kajtar, 2009), a value of ``\beta = 3`` for cubic smoothing_kernels
and ``\beta = 2`` for quintic kernels is reasonable for most computing purposes.

The parameter ``K`` is used to scale the force exerted by the boundary particles.
In (Monaghan, Kajtar, 2009), a value of ``gD`` is used for static tank simulations,
where ``g`` is the gravitational acceleration and ``D`` is the depth of the fluid.

The viscosity ``\Pi_{ab}`` is calculated according to the viscosity used in the
simulation, where the density of the boundary particle if needed is assumed to be
identical to the density of the fluid particle.
